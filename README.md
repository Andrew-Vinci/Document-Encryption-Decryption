## Description

This project uses C++ and various Algorithms in order to encrypt and decrypt
text files. It works by taking in a text file and provided by the user, and giving the option
to use either a sorted or unsorted codex. The codex is the text file that the program pulls from 
to actually encrypt, and then later decrypt, the documents.

I ended up using two different types of searching algorithms with this project. There are two options that are given to the user, the first is for a sorted codex and the second is for an unsorted codex. They both have different benefits. The sorted codex is fairly quick for long text files. It uses merge sort and binary search.

Compared to the unsorted codex, which is quick for small to medium text files. This uses sequential search. It can be used with both sorted and unsorted codex files. I also added a decryption function that allows the user to decrypt a document that has been encoded with the given codex file.

This project was done as a culmination of my Data Structures & Algorithms class at Champlain College. I'm very
proud of this project. It may not look like much but its fully functional and works exactly as it should. It does a pretty decent job at decrypting as well, given you dont have the means to decrypt it. It can actually be use din the real world for your spy activities.

Not only that, but this project is also a demonstration of my C++ and Data Strucutres and Algorithms knowlege. I learned programming through C++ and projects just like this and I feel as if this is one of my best demonstrations of determination and sticking it out to see a project through to the end.

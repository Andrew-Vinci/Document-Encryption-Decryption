As I talked to these digital explorers, ranging from those who tamed multimillion dollar machines in the 1950s to contemporary young wizards who mastered 
computers in their suburban bedrooms, I found a common element, a common 
philosophy which seemed tied to the elegantly flowing logic of the computer itself. 
It was a philosophy of sharing, openness, decentralization, and getting your hands: 
on machines at any cost to improve the machines, and to improve the world. This? 
Hacker Ethic is their gift to us: something with value even to those of us with no! 
interest at all in computers. a's even? those- ("#@a's"). ("#@fdkjfdkj").

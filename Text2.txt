We have also told our fellow citizens in Britain about what has been happening here. We have specifically warned them about what the government was up to, and all that has happened since we immigrated here. 
We have tried to remind them of our common bonds, but they too have ignored us. Thus, we have to treat them like we would any other people, enemies in war or friends in peace. 
Therefore, we as the Representatives of the United States of America, appealing to the judgement of God for the purity of our intentions, 
do in the name of the people declare that we are independent states that shall have no further political connection with Great Britain. 
As independent states we have the power to engage in war, make peace, make alliances, engage in trade, and every other power that independent states possess. 
In support of this declaration, relying on the protection of God, we pledge to each other our lives, fortunes, and sacred honor.
